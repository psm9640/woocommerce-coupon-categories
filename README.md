# WooCommerce Coupon Category Taxonomy

### Overview
This functionality adds a custom taxonomy to WooCommerce coupons called **"Coupon Category."** This is especially useful when managing a large number of coupon codes, such as those created for affiliates, promotions, or different customer groups.

### Why Use Coupon Categories

When dealing with hundreds of coupon codes, organizing them by category helps with:

1. **Better Organization**  
   Categorize coupon codes based on their purpose (e.g., affiliates, seasonal promotions) to make managing them easier in the WordPress admin.
   
2. **Custom Rules**  
   Use the taxonomy to create more complex discount logic by checking the category of a coupon when writing custom rules, automations, or scripts.

### Example Use Case

You can write custom code to apply different discounts or behaviors based on the assigned coupon category. For example:
- Assign affiliate coupons to one category and seasonal promotions to another.
- Target specific categories of coupons with unique discount behaviors or conditions.

This feature not only simplifies the management of large numbers of coupons but also provides greater flexibility for advanced WooCommerce customizations.

### Installation

1. Add the PHP code to your themeâ€™s `functions.php` file or include it in a custom plugin.
2. After installation, the **Coupon Category** taxonomy will appear in the admin area under the **Coupons** section, allowing you to categorize your coupons.
